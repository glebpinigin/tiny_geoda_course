# About

Welcome to the GeoDa for Economists course materials page. The course is focused on spatial data analysis using GeoDa. It is designed for a wide range of specialists with experience in analyzing economic data using Excel and BI tools. The course covers such sections as plots creation, thematic maps, data clustering, geostatistical analysis
using GeoDa. [GeoDa](http://geodacenter.github.io/) is a free and open-source software
for Windows, MacOS and Linux mostly developed by The University of Chicago.

Thematic mapping and geostatistics are very useful techniques for evaluating spatially
distributed phenomena. Analyzing patterns of spatial distribution of data collected
in administrative areas, regions, buildings gives an important insight for developing
social and economic models. Applying spatial analysis techniques it is possible to
assess spatial irregularity and the impact of associated facilities on land values.

GeoDa is a feature-rich thus simple GIS software. It allows users to build and
simultaneously analyze several types of multivariate plots and maps, and provides
an environment for wide variety of geostatistical computations.

Our course is structured as follows:

- The Introduction. A 45-minute talk about the essence of cartography and spatial data
analysis;
- Plots and thematic maps. 2 lessons with 2 practical exercises about visualizing
data in GeoDa;
- Clustering and geostatistics. 3 lessons with 3 practical exercises about applying spatial data analysis techniques in GeoDa.

The course was developed by Lomonosov Moscow State University students Baryshkin P.,
Volokh E., Mikhailova M., Pinigin G., Romakh E., Sokhrannykh V. as part of their English
classes under the supervision of Dr. Kargashin P.
