The common ways to explain why to do so are Tobler’s laws of geography: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things The phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside — Waldo Tobler In fact, you shall not interpret these as strict laws of any kind. However it is very useful to treat these statements as initial hypotheses for spatial data analysis. In order to check whether any spatial pattern is or is not presented in a phenomenon, you can apply different techniques. Exploratory data analysis can be performed with spatial data, displaying a map is a way to visually evaluate quantitative features of spatial distribution, spatial statistics is a set of techniques to estimate qualitative features of spatial distribution. And our course follows this order to undercover you exciting world of spatial data analysis.

This GIS has prepared datasets and today we’ll use one of them. We’re going to work with Boston Housing 1970s, which contains housing and neighborhood data for the city of Boston based on research from the 1970s-90s. This dataset is a point shapefile with 506 observations and 23 variables. To open this data you have to choose File&gt;New and to choose Boston Home Sales from Sample Data. After that you’ll be able to see the spatial distribution of the parameter. In the bottom left you’ll see the information about the number of observations. Figure 3.1: Opening the dataset Figure 3.2: Boston Housing 1970s 3.2 Specific od data storage in GIS To understand what observations and variables stand for we have to find out some facts about the ways of storing data in GIS. In GIS each object in a dataset consists of 2 parts: geometric (you see it) and semantic (responsible for the property of the object and represented as a row in a table). So, the semantic part is a table, where each line is an object of a dataset and each column contains the characteristic of the object. It means that the number of observations is a number of objects (rows) and the number of variables stands for the number of object characteristics (columns). Figure 3.3: Storing data in GIS 3.3 Graphic types in GeoDa There’re 8 types of graphics in GeoDA: Histogram, Box Plot, Scatter Plot, Scatter Plot, Matrix, Bubble Chart, 3D Scatter Plot, Conditional Plot Figure 3.4: Types of graphics in GeoDa 3.3.1 Histogram Histogram shows the meanings of one variable for each chosen object. You have to push the histogram button on the control panel and to choose the variable you need. If you want to create histogram not for all objects, but for concrete ones, you have to choose them either from the table or from the map. In that case the histogram will show the meanings of the variable for all objects and for chosen ones. To open the table, you have to push the button on the control panel. To chose other colors for the histogram or to export it as an image, you have to click it with the right button and to choose the option you need. This works for all types of graphics in GeoDa. Figure 3.5: Creating Histogram in GeoDa 3.3.2 Box plot Boxplots are created to represent the distribution of a numeric variable. The graphic reflects maximum and minimum values, median, first and last quantiles and p-values at the same time. To create boxplot, you also just have to push the button on the control panel and to choose the variable you need. Boxplot also has some numeric characteristics for easier interpretation. Figure 3.6: Creating Box plot in GeoDa 3.3.3 Scatter plot Scatter plot is based on using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically 2 variables for a dataset. There’re 3 types of Scatter plots in GeoDa. To create each of them, you still have to push a specified button on a control panel and create the variables. For classical scatter plot you’ll have to choose 2 of them. The 3D Scatter plot uses the 3-dimensial representation for 3 variables. Finally, the Scatter plot Matrix is a grid of scatter plots used to visualize bivariate relationships between combinations of variables. Here you can choose more than 2 or 3 variables for comparison, if you need. To create scatter plots, you also just have to push the button on the control panel and to choose the variable you need. Figure 3.7: Creating Scatterplot and Scatterplot Matrix in GeoDa Figure 3.8: Creating 3D Scatterplot in GeoDa 3.3.4 Bubble Chart A bubble chart is a type of data visualization that uses circles (bubbles) to represent data points in a two-dimensional plot. It is similar to a scatter plot, but uses bubbles instead of dots. Typically, a bubble chart shows the values of three numeric variables, with each circle representing an observation and its position on the plot indicating the values of two other variables. To create bubble chart, you also have to push the button on the control panel and to choose the variable you need. Figure 3.9: Creating Bubble Chart in GeoDa 3.3.5 Parallel coordinates plot Parallel coordinates plot is a common way of visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional datasets. A point in n-dimensional space is represented as a polyline with vertices on the parallel axes and the position of the vertex corresponds to the coordinate of the point. To create it, you have to push the button on the control panel and to choose the variable you need. Figure 3.10: Creating Parallel coordinates plot in GeoDa 3.3.6 Conditional plot Conditional plot consists of two variables conditional on the value of a third variable. You can create a map, a histogram, a scatter plot or a boxplot, using the button on a control panel. You’ll have to choose 3 variables and get 9 graphics, showing their dependencies. Figure 3.11: Creating a Conditional plot in GeoDa 3.4 Practical exercise To check yourself after this lesson you have to built 3 Graphics for the observations with the towno=27. 1.

We will explore thematic mapping toolkit using Chicago Community Area dataset which has a large attribute table. It allows us to create a huge variety of thematic maps. Figure 3.1: Chicago Community Area dataset 4.1 What is a thematic map? But first, what is a thematic map? Roughly speaking, a thematic map is a map about certain theme. It’s interesting to see some kind of geographical pattern of a particular subject matter that’s why we use such maps. The GeoDa allows us to create different kinds of a thematic maps. So, let’s focus on some of them. During the lesson, we will use the interface which is shown on the left part of the slide. Figure 3.2: Thematic maooing toolkit 4.2 Control panel When the window opens, you will notice several icons at the top. That tools are used to select elements on the map, invert the selection, zoom in and zoom out. Also you can add the basemap. The tools details we will describe later. Figure 3.3: Control panel 4.3 Quantile map Now, let’s explore some mapping options. You can create a map using quantiles, dividing the entire data array into equal parts. You have the opportunity to choose the number of parts, ranging from two to ten.This kind of map is effective in accurately depicting the distribution of the indicator. By dividing it into equal intervals, we can easily identify the geographical patterns of the phenomenon’s distribution throughout the territory. Figure 3.4: Quantile map 4.4 Percentile map Another possible choropleth is a percentile map, which enables the visualization of the percentage distribution of the variable by region.This map is suitable for displaying a non-uniform distribution. Figure 3.5: Percentile map 4.5 Standard deviation map Another interesting map is the standard deviation map which shows the deviation of the variable in each area from the average for all areas. If you wish to present the deviation of values in each cell from the mean, then this map option can be utilized. Figure 3.6: Standard deviation map 4.6 Unique values map and choosing a color Sometimes it’s important to create the unique values map. With this kind of map you can focus on the color customization options in detail. In previous examples we used a gradient scale filling. But it’s also necessary to customize color palette for optimal appearance. To do so, right-click on the color icon, select “Flip Color for Category” from the menu, and choose the color from the options. Figure 3.7: Unique values map and choosing a color 4.7 Custom breaks with category editor Another helpful feature in GeoDa is a scale division using different methods. The methods are natural intervals and equal intervals. Also you can create your own custom division method adjusting such parameters as the number of intervals, a value, and a method.This option is useful if you want to selectively highlight specific value groups and indicate them on the map. This can assist the data user in establishing logical connections. Figure 3.8: Custom breaks with category editor 4.8 Bubble map (cartogram) You can create bubble map or cartogram with two variables. On picture on the right you can see that a circle size and a color visualize two different variables. All the previous maps have demonstrated the distribution of a single indicator. If you need to showcase the spatial relationship between two indicators, then this version of the map should be used. Figure 3.9: Bubble map (cartogram) 4.9 Basemap In conclusion, it is important to note a big variety of available basemaps in the software. You can choose not only default maps and satellite images but also specify a path to other map server location. Figure 3.10: Basemap 4.10 Save and export To save your map, right-click on an empty space in the map window and select “Save Image As.” In the window that appears, you can adjust the map size and position of the legend. Figure 3.11: Save and export 4.11 Exercise As an exercise, you should create three different maps using the specified dataset. The first map is a quantile map with 6 intervals, the second map is a percentile map and the third one is a standard deviation map. Write 5 sentences about differences between the first two maps. Change the colors and select a basemap for the standard deviation map. Save all three maps in .png format. 4.12 Cheat Sheet If you want to reflect 1 indicator: Use a quantile map if you want to display a measure divided into equal intervals; Use a percentile map if you want a different division of the indicator; If you wish to present the deviation of values in each cell from the mean, then this map option can be utilized If you want to represent the deviation of values ​​ in each map cell from the mean, use a standard deviation map You can use a unique values map if you want to mark areas where the indicator values ​​are the same; You can use other scale division options to manipulate data and visualize it on a map. If you need to demonstrate spatial relationships between two indicators, then a cartogram should be used.

Part 1 6.1 What is spatial statistics? Spatial statistics is a branch of mathematical statistics that deals with the numerical description of variables distributed in geographic space. Most often, tools of spatial statistics are used to solve the problem of interpolation. In other words, we reconstruct a continuous field of distribution of a random variable from a limited set of data at observation points. However, spatial statistics as a scientific discipline is much wider, with its primary task being the statistical description of spatial distributions. 6.2 Why spatial statistics is important? Spatial statistics is based on a widely developed mathematical apparatus, and understanding the basics of it is a necessary condition for the deliberate use of geostatistical methods in practice. The world of spatial statistics is based on the fundamental concepts of random variables, random functions, and random processes. Measuring uncertainty is critical to decision making because it provides information about possible outcomes for all locations, not just one predicted value. The GeoDa software has a wide range of spatiostatistical tools, primarily focused on finding spatial correlations in existing data. So, it is essential to explore how to use GeoDa to solve spatial tasks. Figure 3.1: Spatial Econometrics topic in Science Direct portal 6.3 Theory The starting point of geostatistical analysis is a set of points \\(\\{p_1,p_2,...,p_n\\}\\) called locations, each of which includes the value \\(\\{Z(p_1),Z(p_2),...,Z(p_n)\\}\\) of some spatial variable. The spatial and attribute components are traditionally divided into two, and both can be random. Values in locations are obtained by measuring a spatially distributed variable. The measurement results, like the data used for calculations, usually characterize the state of the environment at a certain moment. To work with such data, the concept of a random variable is used. Therefore, a random variable is a function that, as a result of a random event, takes on a real value, and a random process is a family of random variables indexed by some parameter. Random variable \\(Z(w)\\) is a function, that, as a result of a random event \\(w\\), takes on a real value Random process is a family of random variables indexed by some parameter \\(t\\) 6.4 Pre-prepared data Now, let’s explore the existing pre-prepared data available in the software. For example, we can examine the Boston Housing 1970s dataset, which includes housing and neighborhood data for the city of Boston based on research from the 1970s—90s. Figure 3.2: Overview of Boston Housing 1970s dataset It contains 506 observations with 23 variables, each point representing a house for sale. Let’s take two variables from the dataset that will help us solve a specific problem. Imagine you are working in the Boston housing market. It is necessary to find out in which part of the city it is profitable to sell housing with a large number of rooms. So the numeric vectors of median values of owner-occupied housing in $USD (medv) and the average numbers of rooms per dwelling (rm), can help us determine whether the value of a variable depends on the surroundings of points in space. 6.5 Moran’s I tests One of the easiest ways to study whether there is a relationship between values in each location and in neighboring locations is the Moran’s Index test. Moran’s I statistic is arguably the most commonly used indicator of global spatial autocorrelation, expressed as a cross-product statistic between a variable and its spatial lag, with the variable expressed in deviations from its mean. Moran’s I statistic is then given by the formula: \\(I = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} w_ij z_i \\cdot z_j/S_0}{\\sum_{i}z_i^2/n}\\) with \\(w\\) as the elements of the spatial weights matrix, \\(S_0\\) as the sum of all the weights, and n as the number of observations. 6.6 Weights matrix creation First of all, we need to calculate the spatial weights matrix. To do this, click on the “W” icon located on the instrument panel. Figure 3.3: Weight Manager icon In the pop-up window, we begin to create a matrix of weights by clicking the “create” button. Figure 3.4: Weight Manager icon The study of spatial autocorrelation begins with an analysis of geographic proximity. That is, for each analyzed unit, we must determine the adjacent units. This is not so simple because there are many ways to define a neighborhood. GeoDa can calculate spatial weights by contiguity and by distance. Contiguity-based adjacency is used when analyzing data associated with area units, such as an administrative division grid. So, this is not our case, and we will calculate distance weights. Select the ID variable at the top of the window, then select the X- and Y-coordinate variables from the list below. Leave the rest of the fields with default settings. Click “create” and save the spatial weight file in your home directory. Figure 3.5: Weight Manager icon 6.7 Visualizing adjacency After that, in the “Weights Manager” pop-up window, you can see that the characteristics of the weights file appear. Figure 3.6: Spatial weights table in Weights Manager In that window, you can also explore a neighbors’ histogram, connectivity map, and connectivity graph. Figure 6.1: Connectivity map Figure 6.2: Connectivity graph Figure 6.3: Neighbours’ histogram It’s interesting to see how the spatial algorithm works, and it’s also helpful to choose the correct type of adjacency to create appropriate spatial weights. 6.8 Global Moran’s I test Now that a weights matrix has been created, we will use the Moran’s I tests to estimate the best district for selling houses. This test allows us to assess the statistical relationship between the value of the indicator in each location and in neighboring locations. Based on Moran’s test result, we can estimate spatial regression for different types of forecasts. There are two basic types of Moran’s tests. The global Moran’s test evaluates the presence of statistical dependence for the entire set of points, while the local test evaluates each point separately. First of all, let’s calculate the univariate Moran’s test. Click on the Space tab, choose the Univariate Moran’s I test, select the “medv” variable, and click OK. Figure 3.8: Univariate Moran’s I menu The Moran’s test scatter plot appears. Figure 3.9: Univariate Moran’s I scatter plot Moran’s index ranges from -1 to 1. Our result is 0.269, which means that there is a weak statistical relationship between the cost of housing at each point and the neighboring points. We can also estimate a bivariate Moran’s test in same way. Instead of using the univariate Moran’s test, click on the bivariate Moran’s test and select the medv and rm variables. Figure 6.4: Bivariate Moran’s menu Figure 6.5: Bivariate Moran’s I scatter plot The spatial correlation between housing medium values and number of rooms is exist. Now let’s explore in which areas of Boston will the relationship between variables be the greatest. 6.9 Local Moran’s I test For that purpose we can calculate the Local Moran’s I test. This test is much more interesting than the global test because we can create maps. Let’s try to calculate the univariate Local Moran’s test. Select the medv variable once again and click OK. Figure 3.11: Local Moran’s I map menu In the pop-up window, you can choose three types of graphics. The first two are the cluster and significance maps that illustrate the spatial statistical differences. Mark both maps and click OK. The cluster map shows how strongly the cost of housing in neighboring locations is related to the cost of housing in each location, and the significance map shows how significant a statistical relationship is. The smaller the p-value, the greater the significance. Similarly, you can perform a local Moran’s test for two variables. Just choose the medv and rm values in the pop-up window, and you will see a result. Figure 6.6: Cluster map Figure 6.7: Significance map The cluster map allows us to understand in which areas of the city housing with a big number of rooms can be sold at a higher price. In the high-high and low-low areas houses with a small number of rooms are located. It is not profitable to sell housing with a large number of rooms there. Interesting to explore the high-low areas. Houses with a small number of rooms are located there. At the same time, there are houses with a large number of rooms around. Increasing prices for such apartments will not have a repulsive effect. It means that we need to choose a high-low areas to increase housing prices as a realtor. "],["spatial-statistics-in-geoda.-part-2.html", "Chapter 7 Spatial statistics in GeoDa.

Part 2 7.1 Previous lection In the previous lesson you have learned why spatial dependence is important, also you have learned some basics including Moran’s Index. There are two types of Moran’s statistics. First is global Moran’s test. This test allows us to assess the statistical relationship between the value of the indicator in each location and in neighboring locations. Second is local Moran’s test. Using this method you can create maps which can illustrate the spatial statistical differences between variables. In general, Moran’s Index is needed when you need to prove the importance of connection between two variables. But also there are a lot of different methods to explore the data. 7.2 Theme of the lesson In this lesson you will study the additional spatial statistics methods represented in GeoDa: Joint Count Local Geary Quantile LISA Spatial Correlogram Linear regression 7.3 Contiguity and spatial weights Contiguity and spatial weights are the two things which you can use in the weight manager in the next cases. In its simplest form, the spatial weights matrix expresses the existence of a neighbor relation as a binary relationship, with weights 1 and 0. Usually this matrix is very sparse with a lot of zeros in it. Contiguity means that two spatial units share a common border of non-zero length. Operationally, we can further distinguish between a rook and a queen criterion of contiguity, in analogy to the moves allowed for the such-named pieces on a chess board. 7.4 Joint count methods 7.4.1 Theoretical basis Joint Count method is a technique for processing discrete variables, especially for binary variables. It is used to identify clusters in binary variables by means of the local joint count statistics. The statistics consists of counting the joins that correspond to occurrences of value pair at neighboring locations. Mathematic representation of this method: \\[ BB_i = x_i\\sum_{j}{w_i w_j}x_j \\] This equation means that Joint Count is a sum of neighbors of \\(x_i\\) which are have the same value that x. In conclusion, you can use these methods to determine if there is a spatial connection between events or they are distributed in the random way. ### Implementation in GeoDa To create map using this method you have to create a weight matrix first: 1. Open the Weights Manager 2. Choose “Create” 3. Select an ID variable in your dataset 4. Choose type of contiguity 5. Choose variable as spatial weight 6. Save the weight data In the end you will see similar picture: Figure 3.1: Weights Manager After creating the weight matrix you can make the map. The only available option is a significant map. 1. Open Local Joint Count in Space bar menu 2. Select the variable you want to explore Figure 3.2: Local Join Count Significance Map This map represents a spatial significance of negative population growth in Chicago city, IL. It means that the regions colored in green have strong connection between their location and decreasing its population. The reason can be different, but this reason stronngly affects to them. 7.5 Local Geary 7.5.1 Theoretical basis Local Geary is a method to find the spatial autocorrelation through dissimilarity of data. It means that small values of the statistics suggest positive spatial autocorrelation, whereas large values suggest negative spatial autocorrelation. It can be more precise that Local Moran test in some cases because of differences in attribute similarity. 7.5.2 Implementation in GeoDa First, you need to prepare the weight matrix like in the previous step. Next step is to open “Local Geary” in Space bar menu and select the variable. In spite of Joint Count method you can choose two options for the maps. First is a cluster map which is a representation of attribute dependencies. Second variant is a significance map like in the Joint Count method. Figure 3.3: Local Geary Cluster Map. Tuberculosis in Chicago The cluster map is a great way to show spatial dependencies connected with attributes. Theoretically there are five categories. First category is a “Not Significant”. It means that there is no dependency between attribute and spatial component. Second category is a “High-High”. It this category there is a strong positive connection between attribute and location. The next category is a “Low-Low”. This category represents straight, but negative connection. It means that surrounding area has the similar low values of the attribute like this regions. The fourth category represents low significant straight connection. The last category is about negative connection between this region and surrounding area. But what it means in the practical way? Map shown in the top represents the connection between location and tuberculosis spreading, but let’s imagine that it is a cost of the flat in condominium. In the areas with “High-High” category there are high prices both in the colored regions and surrounding area. In the “Low-Low” areas cost is low in the similar way. Despite of this places the areas with negative connection have a potential for a good deal. You need to estimate is this place has a lower price that in surrounding area or not. If it is you can save your money. Figure 3.4: Local Geary Significance Map. Tuberculosis in Chicago The Significance map represents power of the connection between attributes and spatial location like in the Joint Count method. 7.6 Quantile LISA 7.6.1 Theoretical basis Quantile LISA or quantile local spatial autocorrelation is a method to find spatial autocorrelation between two or multiple continuous variables. Linear association measured by Bivariate Local Moran suffers from the location problem. Quantile LISA added a spatial component for measuring correlations. More often it is used when the focus is on extremes of the distribution. 7.6.2 Implementation in GeoDa First do the steps like in Joint Count and Local Geary methods with creation of spatial weights. Next you need to select the variables and quantiles for analysis. Figure 3.5: Selecting quantiles and number of quantiles Let’s explore how extreme poverty is connected with teen pregnancy. Select the category and use the last quantile. In this case we will see the dependency between proportion of people with income less than 50% of povery minimum and number of teen pregnancies. Figure 3.6: Quantile LISA Significance Map. Connection between extreme povery and number of teenage pregnancies Like in the previous methods we can make a significance map representing power of spatial correlation between attributes. 7.7 Spatial correlogram 7.7.1 Theoretical basis A non-parametric spatial correlogram is an alternative measure of global spatial autocorrelation that does not rely on the specification of a spatial weights matrix. Instead, a local regression is fit to the covariances, or correlations computed for all pairs of observations as a function of the distance between them. The non-parametric correlogram is computed by means of a local regression on the pairwise correlations that fall within each distance bin. The number of bins determines the distance range of each bin. This range is the maximum distance divided by the number of bins. The more bins are chosen, the more fine-grained the correlogram will be 7.7.2 Implementation in GeoDa First choose Spatial correlogram in space bar tools. Next choose the data. You will see the “Correlogram Parameters” menu. Figure 3.7: Selecting quantiles and number of quantiles You should choose variable for analysis and number of beans first. Note that there is an option that it will be no spatial dependency between distance of the regions and attribute values. Figure 3.8: Correlogram between number of assaults and distance As you can see there is a little dependency between this two variables. It means that number of assaults decreases with increasing distance parameter between two regions. It can representate the fact that unfortunate districts are close to each other and they are located in the big distance from prosperous ones. 7.8 Regression 7.8.1 Theoretical basis Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the standard regression parameters of the model are constant. It means that there is no difference in spatial dependence between variables. To solve this problem, you can use geographically weighted regression. In this method weights are defined for every location individually. In the mathematical point of view weight coefficient matrix is used where close points have higher influence rate than far ones. 7.8.2 Implementation in GeoDa Note that regression is in different menu than other spatial statistics tools You need to select dependent and independent variables You may add additional weights file Figure 3.9: Settings of the regression After processing you will see the Regression Report. Figure 3.10: Regression Report There are two key points in it. First: R-squared – statistical measure that determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable. Second: F-value – statistical measure where the null hypothesis is that all the regression coefficients are equal to zero. In this case regression can’t predict the model of connection between data. 7.9 Conclusion Use Joint Count methods if you need to process with binary data Use Local Geary methods if you need to describe the contiguous data and find similarity and dissimilarity areas Use Quantile LISA if you need to process contiguous data with multiple variable and find an autocorrelation Use spatial correlogram if you need to find correlation between differences of variable and different distances Use a regression to prove your concept 7.10 Task Explore the spatial correlation between poverty with cancer deaths per 100 000 people in Chicago region. Use this dataset: https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/comarea_vars/ Use Pov200P as an independent variable and CancerAll as dependent variable Try Local Geary and Quantile LISA to find autocorrelation and make map. In the end use regression tool to make a conclusion between their dependency Describe the result which you get with significance maps and regression report "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
